            "Enter the text you want to summarize: Early observers looking at the night sky noticed patterns in the stars . These patterns, which we call constellations, might appear to change place, but they don’t change shape. People around the world gave them names (like  Orion the hunter or Leo the lion) and told stories about them. You may know some of these stories as myths, or as astrology. Astrology can be fun to think about, but it’s different from astronomy. Astrology is not science!   Early observers also noticed some bright objects in the sky that seem to wander around among the stars. The ancient Greek philosophers called these objects “planets,” which is Greek for “wanderers.” The planets are our near neighbors, and they do move. They orbit the Sun , just as Earth does.  2. The sky is vast and distances between objects can be very large  To the naked eye, the stars look like tiny points of light . But stars are not tiny—they're huge, burning balls of gas, like our Sun. They just appear small because they are so far away. The nearest star to our solar system is 4 light years away, which is 20 trillion miles.\n",
